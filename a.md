# Concurrent Programming in Go

Concurrent Programming in Go
This project demonstrates various techniques for concurrent programming in Go, including:

1. Concurrent increment and decrement of a global variable using goroutines and mutexes
2. Creating a goroutine for each element in a slice and using a WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to complete
3. Implementing a simple producer-consumer pattern using channels
4. Reading the contents of multiple files concurrently and protecting the shared data structure with a Mutex
5. Limiting the number of concurrent goroutines using a buffered channel
6. Periodically retrieving data from a remote server using goroutines and channels
7. Implementing a worker pool using goroutines and channels
8. Creating a goroutine for each element in a slice and using a WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to complete before the program exits
